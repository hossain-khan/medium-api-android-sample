Posts published as &#39;public&#39; or &#39;unlisted&#39; will appear in collection immediately, while posts created as &#39;draft&#39; will remain in pending state under publication.   - If the authenticated user is a &#39;writer&#39; for the chosen publication, they can only create a post as a &#39;draft&#39;. That post will remain in pending state under publication until an editor for the publication approves it.   - If the authenticated user is neither a &#39;writer&#39; nor an &#39;editor&#39;, they are not allowed to create any posts in a publication. 
   * @param publicationId Here publicationId is the id of the publication the post is being created under. The publicationId can be acquired from the API for listing userâ€™s publications. (required)
